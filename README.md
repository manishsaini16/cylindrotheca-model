# Genome scale metabolic model of Cylindrotheca closterium

Within this repository, you can find two key components: (i) a genome-scale metabolic model of *Cylindrotheca closterium* TJRE Ct-21, and (ii) all scripts and data associated with the figures presented in our paper entitled "Mixotrophic growth of a ubiquitous marine diatom". C. closterium was isolated from the Tijuana River Estuary (TJRE) outflow, located in San Diego County, California, USA. For more details, click here (A link to the manuscript  will be added here)
